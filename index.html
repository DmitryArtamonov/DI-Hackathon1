                To access medical services, citizens of Israel and new immigrants must obtain state health insurance. Fortunately, you don't have to go to a special insurance company for this - both insurance registration and medical services in Israel are provided by health funds.
                <br><br>
                Regardless of which health fund you choose, the insurance will provide you with a package of standard medical services. This package includes doctor consultations, laboratory and instrumental examinations, therapeutic procedures, outpatient treatment, as well as rehabilitation services and basic medications. However, not all services will be free - for example, you will have to pay for some prescription drugs, although with a significant discount.
                <br><br>
                In addition, when registering with a health fund, you will be offered several "levels" of insurance - the higher the level, the more services you can receive.
                <br><br>
                There are 4 health funds in Israel, and you can receive services from any of them.

            <h2>How to get an insurance</h2>
            <article>
                Upon arrival at Ben-Gurion airport, you will be given a form with an empty field for choosing a health fund. In this section, you can write down the organization that suits you best. Think about this question in advance and, first of all, check if there are clinics near your place of residence that are covered by the chosen health fund.
                <br><br>
                After filling out the document and receiving your immigrant certificate, you can go to the chosen health fund and complete the registration process. After obtaining health insurance, you will receive a magnetic card - with its help you will make appointments with a doctor, take queue numbers in clinics, and also receive prescription drugs.
                <br><br>
                You can change your health fund, but no more than once every six months. To do this, go to the post office bank in person or submit the corresponding application through the website of the National Insurance Institute of Israel.

            <h2>Additional services</h2>
            <article>
                All health funds in Israel offer several insurance options. They differ in cost, name, and the number of available services, but their essence is roughly the same. The basic insurance covers the needs of the vast majority of the population - citizens without serious or chronic illnesses who rarely visit clinics but sometimes undergo a "check-up" of the body.
                <br><br>
                Extended insurance is another matter. This service takes into account the preferences of more demanding patients. For example, Leumit's extended insurance includes visits to a dermatologist and corresponding medications. Thanks to this insurance, patients with skin problems can partially or fully cover therapeutic and diagnostic procedures that are not included in the basic package.
                <br><br>
                The choice of insurance is up to you. As a rule, the cost difference between basic and extended service packages is small, and a significant portion of Israeli citizens choose the second option. Therefore, before making a final decision, I recommend that you carefully review the services offered by different health funds and only then arrange insurance.
