        Leumit is the youngest health fund among the four medical organizations in Israel. It has about 720,000 patients, 320 medical centers, and 150 pharmacies. Leumit aims to increase the number of patients, so it constantly expands its range of services and focuses on new repatriates, including residents of Russia and the CIS.
        <br><br>
        The last fact is especially important. Leumit has its own website in Russian (although with limited functionality), its operators often speak Russian, and when making an appointment with a doctor, it is almost always possible to choose a Russian-speaking specialist.    <div class="contacts">
